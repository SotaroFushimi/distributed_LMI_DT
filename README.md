## How to Use

### Stability Check
For stability analysis, run the following script:
`Stbl_script.m`  
This script will return the number of cases where a stabilizer is successfully derived.

### H∞ Performance Analysis
For H∞ performance analysis, run the following script:
`Hinfty_script.m`

### Modifying Parameters
Parameters for the simulations can be modified in the `parameters.m` file.

### Parameters for the paper
Parameters and results used in the paper is stored at `data/sim_result_paper` folder.
